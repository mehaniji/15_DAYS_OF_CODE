# 15-Day Coding Challenge

## Day 1: Learning STL and Codeforces Practice

Welcome to my 15-day coding challenge! This challenge is designed to help me improve my coding skills and tackle coding problems daily.

### Goals for Day 1

- Watched 3 informative lectures on the Standard Template Library (STL) from the LUV YouTube channel.
- Solved more than 2 coding questions using different STL containers and algorithms to solidify my understanding.
- Spent dedicated time on Codeforces, working on problems for an hour.

### Learning Highlights

The lectures from the LUV YouTube channel were incredibly insightful. I got overview about the key components of the STL, including vectors, maps, sets, and learned vector, vector of vector, pair, pair of vector and vector of pair in detail along with some algorithms like sort and binary search. The practical examples helped me grasp the concepts better.

### Coding Practice

I took on the challenge of solving over 2 coding questions using STL containers and algorithms. Initiall I was getting runtime error but I solved those. These problems were carefully chosen to cover a variety of concepts, . This hands-on practice improved my confidence in applying the newly learned STL techniques.

### Codeforces Session

I dedicated an hour to participate in a Codeforces coding session. This platform provided me with real-world coding challenges that required applying both my algorithmic skills and newly gained knowledge of the STL.
The two problem which I succesfully submited today are:
1->Watermellon Problem #220679438
2->Bit++ Proble #220685186

### What's Next?

I'm excited to continue this 15-day coding challenge. For Day 2, I plan to delve into more advanced STL concepts, attempt complex problem-solving exercises, and perhaps explore different coding platforms to diversify my experience.

Stay tuned for more updates on my coding journey!
